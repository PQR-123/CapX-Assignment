Data Scraper and Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project showcases how to scrape data from a website, preprocess it, train a machine learning model, 1. Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.7+)
- pip (Python's package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook for running and exploring the code.
You will also need an active internet connection for the scraping task.
2. Installation and Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
 .\venv\Scripts\activate
- On macOS/Linux:
 source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries using the provided requirements.txt:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 This will install libraries like:- requests (for web scraping)- beautifulsoup4 (for HTML parsing)- pandas (for data manipulation)- scikit-learn (for machine learning)- jupyter (for running the notebooks)
 3. Running the Project
 Step 1: Start Jupyter Notebook
 Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
 jupyter notebook
 This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. Navigate to the notebooks directory and open the respective files for each stage of the process.
 Step 2: Execute the Notebooks
 The project comprises four main notebooks:
1. Data Scraping (data_scraping.ipynb):
   - Scrapes data from the target website.
   - Saves the scraped data into scraped_data.csv.
 2. Data Preprocessing (data_preprocessing.ipynb):
   - Cleans the data, handles missing values, and prepares it for model training.
 3. Model Training (model_training.ipynb):
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
   - Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) and saves the trained model.
 4. Model Evaluation (model_evaluation.ipynb):
   - Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
 Follow the step-by-step instructions in each notebook to complete the workflow.
 4. File Structure
 The repository is organized as follows:
 notebooks/
 data_scraping.ipynb         # Scraping the data
 data_preprocessing.ipynb    # Preprocessing the data
 model_training.ipynb        # Training the model
 model_evaluation.ipynb      # Evaluating the model
 scraped_data.csv                # Saved dataset (generated by scraper)
 requirements.txt                # List of dependencies
 README.md                       # Project instructions (this file)
 5. Dependencies
 Below are the key Python libraries used in this project:- requests: For sending HTTP requests and receiving responses.- beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML content and extracting useful data.- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.- scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.- jupyter: For running the project notebooks.
 To install these dependencies, run:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Notes
Customizing the Scraper:
The scraper in data_scraping.ipynb is designed for a specific website. If you want to scrape data from a difImproving the Model:
The project uses a simple machine learning model for demonstration. You can experiment with different alExtending the Project:
Add additional features like:
- Automating scraping for multiple pages.
- Deploying the trained model using Flask or FastAPI.
- Visualizing the data preprocessing and model evaluation steps.
7. Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and their solutions:
ModuleNotFoundError:
 Make sure to install all dependencies:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 Scraper Not Working:
 Check if the website's structure has changed. Update the scraper logic to match the new structure.
 Model Underperformance:
 Experiment with feature engineering or try different algorithms and hyperparameters.
 8. Conclusion
 This project provides a hands-on demonstration of:- Web scraping to collect data.- Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data.- Machine learning to build predictive models.- Model evaluation to assess performance.
