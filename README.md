Data Scraper and Prediction Model
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from a website, preprocess it, train a machine learning model, and evaluate the model’s performance, all using Jupyter Notebooks. The project is structured into different notebooks, each demonstrating a specific step in the process.

1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.7+)
pip (Python's package installer)
Additionally, you will need Jupyter Notebook to run the provided notebooks.

2. Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To keep the dependencies isolated, create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the required libraries like requests, beautifulsoup4, pandas, scikit-learn, and jupyter.

3. Running the Project
Step 1: Start Jupyter Notebook
To launch Jupyter Notebook, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. From there, you can open the provided notebooks.

Step 2: Data Scraping
The first step is to scrape data from a specified website. The scraping logic is implemented in the data_scraping.ipynb notebook.

Open the notebooks/data_scraping.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to scrape data and save it into a CSV file.
The scraped data will be saved as scraped_data.csv in your project directory.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Once the data is scraped, you will need to preprocess it. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing it for training.

Open the notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to preprocess the scraped data.
The notebook contains steps for:

Loading the scraped data.
Cleaning and transforming the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
Step 4: Model Training
After preprocessing the data, you can train the machine learning model. The model training is demonstrated in the notebooks/model_training.ipynb notebook.

Open the notebooks/model_training.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to train the machine learning model (Random Forest, for example).
The notebook walks you through:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Defining and training the machine learning model.
Saving the trained model.
Step 5: Model Evaluation
Once the model is trained, you will evaluate its performance using various metrics. The evaluation is performed in the notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb notebook.

Open the notebooks/model_evaluation.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to evaluate the model's performance.
The evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.) will be calculated and displayed.

4. Dependencies
Here are the Python dependencies required for this project:

requests: For web scraping (sending HTTP requests and handling responses).
beautifulsoup4: For parsing HTML and extracting data from web pages.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
jupyter: For running Jupyter notebooks.
To install all dependencies, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Notes
Scraper: The scraper is configured for a specific website. If you wish to scrape from another site, you'll need to adjust the scraping logic in the data_scraping.ipynb notebook (e.g., update HTML parsing tags and classes).

Data Preprocessing: Ensure proper data preprocessing is done, such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables, before proceeding with training the model.

Model Performance: The model performance can be improved by adjusting hyperparameters or experimenting with other machine learning algorithms in the model_training.ipynb notebook.

6. Troubleshooting
Here are some common issues and solutions:

Missing Dependencies: If you get errors about missing libraries, make sure to install all dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Scraping Issues: If the scraper doesn’t work, verify that the website structure hasn’t changed. Modify the HTML parsing logic accordingly.

Model Underperformance: If the model is not performing well, consider trying different algorithms, tuning hyperparameters, or enhancing the feature engineering and preprocessing steps.

7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to:

Scrape data from a website.
Preprocess the data.
Train a machine learning model.
Evaluate the model's performance.
The provided Jupyter notebooks guide you through each step of the process, from scraping to model evaluation. Feel free to modify the project as needed or improve it by adding new features or algorithms.
