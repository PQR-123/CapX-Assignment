Project Overview
This project is designed to:

Scrape messages from a Telegram channel using the Telegram API.
Preprocess the scraped messages.
Perform sentiment analysis on the messages.
Train a machine learning model for predictions based on the processed data.
Features
Telegram Scraper:
Connects to a specified Telegram channel.
Retrieves and stores messages for further analysis.
Preprocessing:
Cleans and prepares the text data for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis:
Evaluates the sentiment of messages (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
Machine Learning:
Builds and trains a predictive model using the processed data.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Required libraries:
telethon for Telegram API interaction
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical computations
sklearn for machine learning
Other libraries as needed (refer to requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Set up your Telegram API credentials:
Add your api_id, api_hash, phone, and channel_username in the script.
Run the notebook to scrape messages and analyze them.
Configuration
Update the following variables in the script with your details:
Required Packages
pandas - For data manipulation.
asyncio - For asynchronous operations.
telethon - For Telegram API interaction.
textblob - For sentiment analysis.
sklearn (submodules):
ensemble - For machine learning models.
metrics - For evaluation metrics.
model_selection - For splitting and validation.
nest_asyncio - For managing nested asynchronous loops.
joblib - For saving and loading models.

python
Copy code
api_id = '<YOUR_API_ID>'
api_hash = '<YOUR_API_HASH>'
phone = '<YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER>'
channel_username = '<CHANNEL_LINK>'
Output
Scraped and preprocessed data
Sentiment analysis results
Machine learning model and predictions
Notes
Ensure your Telegram account is verified and has access to the channel you wish to scrape.
Handle API credentials securely to avoid exposing sensitive data.
